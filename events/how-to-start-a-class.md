## User Groups
User groups have a free block-booking of Wednesday evenings, allowing any group with an interest in something vaguely technical or crafty to use the space for free (assuming noone else has got it first!). 

User groups are exempt from the evening day pass requirement, but donations are welcomed and encouraged.

Free User group bookings must be arranged in advance by emailing [events@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk) and are offered on a case by case basis at the discretion of the Directors / Events NEM.

Currently hosted user groups are:

* [Code Co-op](https://www.meetup.com/CodeCoop-NI)
* [Belfast Linux Users Group (BLUG)](https://www.meetup.com/belfast-lug/)
* [BelfastJS](https://www.meetup.com/Belfast-JS/)
* [Wordpress NI](https://www.meetup.com/Northern-Ireland-WordPress-Meetup/)
* [Belfast Google Developer Group](https://developers.google.com/groups/chapter/117880769522295112261/)
