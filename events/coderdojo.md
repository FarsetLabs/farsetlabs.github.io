CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. Farset Labs' Dojo is run by volunteers from the Farset community and offers a range of computer skills, from web application development to scratch.

At a Dojo, young people learn how to code, develop websites, apps, programs, games and more. Dojos are set up, run by and taught at by volunteers. In addition to learning to code, members meet like minded people, show off what they’ve been working on and so on. CoderDojo makes development and learning to code a fun, sociable, kick ass experience.

Farset's Dojo also puts a strong emphasis on open source and free software, and has a strong network of members and volunteers globally. The Dojo has just one rule: “Above All: Be Cool“, bullying, lying, wasting people’s time and so on is uncool.

It also provides essential teaching and mentorship experience for budding software developers; after all, to teach is to learn twice! And you don't have to be a hardcore code-hacker to mentor; anyone can help to guide these kids through the processes of problem solving, breaking down tasks, thinking in a stepwise fashion, or just picking out the killer-spelling-mistakes like variable names or missing semi-colons!

For more information about Coder Dojo, and how to register as an attendee or a mentor, check out the [CoderDojo global webpage](https://zen.coderdojo.com/dojos/gb/belfast/farset-dojo-belfast).

# FAQs

## What should I bring to the event?

We don't have the resources available to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop/tablet/smartphone, that'd be great.

## Is there an age limit to enter the event?

CoderDojo is aimed loosely at the under 18's, but any child younger than 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian and that guardian must stay on-site for the duration of the event

## Can I join as a mentor/volunteer?

Yes! We always appreciate more hands on deck, but we do need to put people through a short induction/training programme first, so get in touch with us on [dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:dojo@farsetlabs.org.uk) and we can add you to the next induction stream.

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

We're 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus

## Is there a charge for the event

Farset Labs' members operate the CoderDojo for free for all attendees, but donations to cover operating costs are greatly appreciated.

## What Child Protection Policies are in place?

Only those registered may attend, including mentors. For full details, see [Farset Labs' Child Protection Policy](/about/child_protection.html). At the lead mentors' discretion, the event space may be sealed off from the rest of the space.

## I can't make it, what can I do to help?

If you can't make it to our Dojo, consider some of the other Dojos in [Northern Ireland](https://zen.coderdojo.com/find?q=Northern%20Ireland&p=1).

If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a [donation](/about/donations.html) to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Dojo.
