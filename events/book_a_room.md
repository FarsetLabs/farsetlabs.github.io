## User Groups

User groups have a free block-booking of Wednesday evenings, allowing any group
with an interest in something vaguely technical or crafty to use the space for
free (assuming noone else has got it first!). User groups are exempt from the
evening day pass requirement, but donations are welcomed and encouraged.

Free User group bookings must be arranged in advance by emailing
[events@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk) and are offered on a
case by case basis at the discretion of the Directors / Events NEM.

## "Have you thought about running....?"

If you've got an idea or suggestion for an event or programme that could be run
at Farset Labs, don't hesitate to get in touch about your plans. We love
encouraging and enabling people to put on interesting and exciting events in the
space.

If you're a member and you want to run something, just start discussing it on
Slack, get a plan together, and fire an email in to
[events@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:events@farsetlabs.org.uk) to book it into the
calendar.
