Come down to Farset Labs Hackerspace the third Monday of the month to our Maker Night in the workshop. Bring your own ideas, or just come to see the pretty burning lights from the safety of our Glowforge Pro laser cutter.

You will get a chance to learn and to use machines in our 24/7 workshop, including:

* Laser cutter
* 3D printer
* CNC router
* Resin casting
* Electronics

[Check out the schedule.](https://www.meetup.com/farsetlabs/events/)

Everyone, of any skill level, or no skill at all is very welcome to join, enjoy the event and learn along the way.
Bring your own computer/laptop/tablet, you will need to use design software and a browser for some of the machines.
