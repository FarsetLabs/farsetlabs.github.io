#FAQs

## Is there an age limit to enter the event?

Raspberry Jam is not specifically aimed at any age range, but any child younger than 14 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian

## What are my transport/parking options getting to the event?

We're 5 minutes walk from Europa Bus Centre, and Parking is available all across the Weavers Court Campus

## Is there a charge for the event

Farset Labs' members operate the Raspberry Jam for free for all attendees, but donations to cover operating costs are greatly appreciated.

## What should I bring to the event?

We don't have the resources available to provide everyone with a machine, so if you can help us out by bringing your own device, be it laptop/tablet/smartphone, that'd be great.

## What Child Protection Policies are in place?

Only those registered may attend, including mentors. For detail into Farset Labs' Child Protection Policy, see our [wiki](http://wiki.farsetlabs.org.uk/Child_Protection_Policy). At the lead mentors' discretion, the event space may be sealed off from the rest of the space.

##I can't make it, what can I do to help?

If you just want to support our event here at Farset Labs, please consider making a donation to the charity and mention in your donation that you wish it to go to fund refreshments, resources, materials, and equipment for the Jams.
