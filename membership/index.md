Join the Hackerspace {#join-the-hackerspace}
=========================

There are four Individual Membership rates to match the most common uses of the space:

-   **Students** (£15pm); occasionally in the space during the day, mostly experiment in the evenings, and are strapped for cash [^2]
-   **Enthusiasts** (£25pm); regularly use the space in the evenings and make regular use of the equipment and space
-   **Freelancers** (£35pm); consistently in the space, regularly hot-desking with ongoing long term projects
-   **Angels** (£75pm); kind people who support the space, regardless of their usage level

All members have voting and room booking[^3] privileges regardless of level.

If you're not sure what category you fall in to, give us a shout on <join@farsetlabs.org.uk> and we'll talk it through.
