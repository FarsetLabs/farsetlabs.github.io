# CCTV Policy and Procedures

## Introduction

The purpose of this Policy is to regulate the management, operation and use of the Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) system at Farset Labs. Cameras are used to monitor activities within the building for the purpose of securing the safety and well being of the Labs, together with its members and guests.

CCTV monitoring and recording systems will only be installed in the building when this has been reviewed and approved by the Board of Trustees.

The system comprises a number of fixed cameras located within the Unit 1/1A building.

The CCTV policy will be registered with the Information Commissioner under the terms of the Data Protection Act 2018. Farset Labs’ use of CCTV complies with the requirements of the [Data Protection Act](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1542/cctv-code-of-practice.pdf) and, where applicable, the [Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000](https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/1064/the_employment_practices_code.pdf).

This policy document will be subject to review annually to include consultation as appropriate with interested parties.

The CCTV system is owned by the Farset Labs.

Independently installed and operated CCTV systems by members will not be permitted, unless explicitly authorised in writing by the trustees. Where found actions will be taken to close these systems down.

## Objectives of the CCTV Policy

The objectives of the CCTV Policy are to:

1. Protect Farset Labs and Member property.
2. Ensure a safer environment within Farset Labs.
3. Support the Police in a bid to deter and detect crime, by providing evidence in support of an enquiry or prosecution.

## Operation of the CCTV System

The CCTV operating system will be administered and managed by the trustees of Farset Labs.

All cameras feed to a central recording system, with a **real-time display system in the Workshop area**. Historical recordings and remote playback facilities are available to the Trustees, bound under the usage constraints defined in this policy.

The CCTV system will be operated **24 hours a day**, 365 days of the year.

Warning signs, as required by the Code of Practice of the Information Commissioner, will be placed at all access routes to areas covered by Farset Labs’ CCTV cameras.

### System control - Monitoring procedures:

Access to the CCTV System will be strictly limited to the trustees. **Unauthorised persons are not permitted to view live or pre-recorded footage remotely.**

Materials or knowledge secured as a result of CCTV will not be used for any commercial or personal purposes.

Recorded data will only be released to the media for use in the investigation of a specific crime and with the written authority of the police. Recorded data will never be released for purposes of entertainment.

### Exemptions:

The CCTV system is designed to ensure maximum effectiveness and efficiency but it is not possible to guarantee that the system will cover or detect every single incident taking place in the areas of coverage.

### Retention and disposal of material:

Footage will be stored on data recorder hard drives for up to **30 days**.

Footage will only be exported if footage is requested directly by external agencies in the process of detecting crime and in the prosecution of offenders.
