# Sponsored Membership Policy

## Terms

* FSL - Farset Labs
* SO - Sponsoring Organisation

## Context

An organisation may wish to sponsor FSL memberships. That SO may
negotiate what membership levels (Student, Standard, Freelance) or
extras (Desk Rental) with FSL, and the price may be discounted for bulk
sponsorships at the discretion of FSL management.

## General Points

There is no limit on the holding duration of sponsored memberships,
however transfers of sponsored membership to third parties must be
confirmed with FSL in advance of transfer.

Sponsored Memberships are taken to be completely equivalent to regular
memberships, including all relevant resource, space, and voting
privileges.

In the case of any misconduct or disciplinary issues, FSL reserves the
right to engage the SO as well as the sponsored member.

Sponsored Memberships will generally be negotiated in terms of Annual
Memberships per Person, but these memberships are divisible down to
monthly memberships at the discretion of the SO (pending notification
processing).

It is the responsibility of FSL to monitor and account for the
Sponsorship Balance and to notify the SO when they are near the end of
their agreed sponsorship quota, however, in the event this quota runs
out with no notification, FSL reserves the right to refuse a
notification of registration that would take the SO over their
sponsorship quota.

## Registration Process

1.  SO selects persons from its cohort / target audience by selection
    or advertising of the sponsored memberships. FSL will happily assist
    in the promotion of this, and the SO may ask to have the sponsorship
    presented on the FSL website / promotional materials. 

2.  SO notifies FSL via [join@farsetlabs.org.uk](mailto:join@farsetlabs.org.uk)
    using the subject “Sponsored Membership Notification” including: 
    1.  Name of sponsored member 
    2.  Contact Email of sponsored member 
    3.  Duration of sponsorship in calendar months 
    4.  (Optional, Default No) Whether or not the SO wishes to be
        included in ongoing sponsored member correspondence regarding
        membership 

3.  FSL will confirm receipt with the SO and will notify the sponsored
    member via their contact address, including standard member
    onboarding notification 

## Payment Process

There are three options for payment of sponsored memberships. Once the
payment process has been agreed upon, it cannot be changed without
renegotiation of the sponsorship agreement.

-   In Advance 
    -   On agreement of a sponsoring programme, FSL will invoice the SO
        for the full agreed balance of the sponsorship.  

-   Per-Member in Advance 
    -   On registration, the FSL will invoice the SO for the proposed
        duration of a single member's sponsorship period. 

-   Monthly 
    -   FSL will invoice the SO each month for the number of sponsored
        memberships registered / active that month.
    -   New registrations will be rounded up/down to the nearest month.
