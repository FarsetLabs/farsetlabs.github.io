### Plan for Easing out of Lockdown

Farset Labs will reopen access to the space in steps aligned with government guidance.

However, we will phase in reopening access for **members** first, then **visitors** and later to small **events** to be safe.

**Social distancing** remains important so please give each other a respectful amount of space when choosing an area
to work and using shared facilities. **Signage and sectioning** will be in place to help.

**Sanitising products** and **personal protective equipment** will be made available to everyone in the space.
