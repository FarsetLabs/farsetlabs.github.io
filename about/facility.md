# Facilities & Resources

Farset Labs is a [makerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) that
provides a place for creativity and technological tinkering. Membership is open
to everyone, no matter what you want to do, and we welcome people from all walks
of life to use our space, come to our events, get involved and foster the maker
community in Northern Ireland.

For a low [membership fee](/membership), students, hobbyists, and all members of
the local community will be able to come together, hack at projects, build stuff
and bring some life to Belfast!

Farset Labs provides members with a wide range of communal resources, so members
can play and build as you wish. These include:

- Dedicated high-speed fibre internet
- Networking, server resources and computers of all sorts such as Raspberry Pis,
  iMacs, and even BBC Micros
- A hefty collection of classic gaming consoles
- Various robots and mobile platforms
- Kitchen and lounge
- A growing library of tools including: 3D printer, vinyl cutter, electronics
  kits, solder stations, part libraries
- Basic metal and woodworking facilities (light-duty pedestal drill and basic
  hand tools)

Typical projects and events include:

- Electronics, communications and computer science
- Manufacturing, making & craft
- Brewing
- Art, music & sculpture
- Local user & interest groups

We provide space, tools and community. Members can come as little or as often as
they like, 24 hours a day, and can use as many of the resources as they please
(within reason!). Farset doesn't ask for anything extra, and we don't take any
stake in your wildly successful ideas. However, we ask members to adhere to a
[Code of Conduct](/community/code_of_conduct) to avoid injury, upset... and
fires.

# The Space
