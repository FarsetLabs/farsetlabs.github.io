# Public Transport

If you plan to take public transport to Farset, use the
[Translink Journey Planner](https://www.translink.co.uk/)
to get timetables. It’s recommended you alight at the Belfast Grand Central
Translink station, which is only a fifteen minute walk from our building.

If you are walking from Grand Central station, take the following
route, or use
[this map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Farset+Labs/@54.5951622,-5.9368974,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x486108f686ba0491:0xf206df9d70d81d76)
to get directions from your current location.

- Exit **Belfast Grand Central Station** onto **Glengall Street** and turn **left**, walking towards the tall **Europa Hotel** at the end of the street.
- Turn **left** onto **Great Victoria Street**, then a **right** onto **Hope Street** and continue straight towards the traffic lights, where [**this mural**](/assets/img/mural.png) will be visible to your left.
- Cross the road and walk down **Linfield Road** (between the mural and the red-brick **Murray's Exchange** building on the right — formerly the Murray & Sons tobacco factory). Continue along Linfield Road around the bend. A large **“Weavers Court” sign** will be visible.
- Walk through the pedestrian gate and enter Weavers Court. If the gates are closed at night, ring the intercom button beside the pedestrian gate for entry.
- **Farset Labs** is the building directly behind the main map, opposite the **Security office**, and is marked C. We are **Unit 1**, and are signposted throughout Weavers Court. Our entrance is directly **below and beside the large orange "C" sign** mounted on the corner of the building, [see this photo](/assets/img/door-instruction.png).

# Driving or cycling to Farset Labs

Enter **Weavers Court** by main gate. Follow the road round to the right, then
take the second left after only about 20m, followed by an immediate right (ie.
don't go under the archway).

We are Unit 1 of the only building on the right. If the gates are closed at night, ring the intercom button beside the pedestrian gate for entry.

**Please do not leave bicycles blocking doors or entrances, or in the way of
equipment or storage areas.**

Note for drivers: during peak hours (08:00-09:30 / 16:30-18:00, Monday –
Friday), parking space may be limited. We have one dedicated space in front of
our door, but otherwise you may need to park in the main car park.
