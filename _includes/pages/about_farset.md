### Who We Are

We are an open community of students, professionals, academics, freelancers,
artists, hackers, and organizers that believe strongly in experimental learning
and the Do-It-Yourself ethic. We facilitate technology initiatives and encourage
hands-on learning by maintaining a [workshop](/about/facility#workshop) and
creative space that is available to members. We maintain an inclusive membership
[policy](/community/rules_and_policies), and strive to apply the principles of
the open-software and open-hardware movements within our design policies.

The space is available to members 24/7 but if you would like to pop in, give us
a shout on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/farsetlabs) or Slack to see if anyone
is about!
